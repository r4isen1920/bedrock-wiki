### How can I test if a player is in the Nether or End?
Detailed explanation of how to do it:
Create a component group for each dimension, or just one if you're only testing one dimension. Then add an environment sensor to the player.json file testing for the ```is_biome``` query. Set the tested biome to ```the_end``` if you are testing for the End dimension. If you are doing the Nether, change the ```all_of``` statement at the beginning of the sensor to ```any_of``` and then run five different biome tests for the five different biome IDs of the 1.16 Nether: ```hell```, ```crimson_forest```, ```warped_forest```, ```soulsand_valley``` and ```basalt_deltas```. Then make an ```is_in_nether``` (or is_in_end, depending on which you do) component group for the player, and make the environment sensor run an event that adds the respective dimension's component group to the player, removing any others if necessary. Each component group will spawn its own custom entity which will run an animation controller to add a tag to the player incidating they are in a certain dimension (for example, /tag @p add inNether), removing other dimensions' tags if necessary. The entity(s) doesn't matter much; just make it despawn after a tick or two. After that, feel free to do whatever you want with the players tagged in their respective dimensions. Back to the previous example, identifying all the players in the Nether dimension will look like @a[tag=inNether].

Tl;dr version:
It can be done through an environment sensor and a bit of json magic.

### Is it possible to only damage an entity when holding specific item?

### Where do I find the molang variable list?
The [molang variable list can be found here](https://bedrock.dev/docs/stable/MoLang).

---
### Can I use /give to get shulker box with items?

---
### What is the max seconds in a /effect command?
 - 2147483647

### How can I freeze an animation when it completes?

- Use `"loop": "hold_on_last_frame"`. This will pause the animation on its last frame, instead of resetting back to the base pose. Useful for things like chests, which need to open and *stay open* until closed.
